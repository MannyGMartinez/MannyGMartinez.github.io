Lab 7 part 1

  I enjoyed lab 7 because we had to take street signs that we see in our everyday life and apply it 
  to a code. I liked how we had to use parking signs and write a function to tell whether parking was allowed in that spot at a given time and date. This shows a cool way in which we can use coding with everyday objects.


Lab 6 part 2

  I enjoyed this lab because we got to use blackjack which is a popular card game. We had to create a function using different card names. I find it really cool how we can bring real world objects into our computer science world.
It allowed me to learn more about playing cards and how they work.



Lab 1

  Even though lab one was difficult for me because I had no prior experience with code so it was a challenge being thrown into the first lab on our first class session. It was stressful but very exciting that I got it done.
